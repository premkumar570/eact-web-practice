description: Create a new React component with CSS file
---

Create a new React functional component in the `/src/components/` directory.

Component requirements:
- Functional component using hooks if needed
- Separate CSS file with matching name
- Export component as default
- Follow existing project patterns (props drilling, no prop-types)
- Use plain CSS (no Tailwind or CSS-in-JS)

Ask me:
1. What is the component name? (PascalCase)
2. What props should it accept?
3. What should the component render?

After creating the component, show me:
- The file path
- Example usage
- Any additional setup needed
