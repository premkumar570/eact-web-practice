description: Add unit tests for a component or page
---

Create unit tests using React Testing Library for a specified component or page.

Test requirements:
- Use React Testing Library and Jest
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Test rendering, user interactions, and prop variations
- Place test file alongside component with `.test.js` extension
- Use `screen` queries and `userEvent` for interactions

Ask me:
1. Which component/page should I test?
2. What specific behaviors should I test?

I'll create tests covering:
- Component renders without crashing
- Props are handled correctly
- User interactions work as expected
- Conditional rendering (if applicable)

Run tests with: `npm test -- ComponentName.test.js`
