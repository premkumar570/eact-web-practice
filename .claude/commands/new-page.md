description: Create a new page with route configuration
---

Create a new page component in `/src/pages/` and configure the route in `App.js`.

Page requirements:
- Create page component in `/src/pages/`
- Create matching CSS file
- Add route to `App.js` router configuration
- Add sidebar menu item if needed
- Follow existing page structure (Dashboard, Members as examples)

Ask me:
1. What is the page name? (PascalCase)
2. What should the route path be? (e.g., /analytics)
3. Should it appear in the sidebar menu?
4. What content should the page display?

After creating the page, I'll:
- Create the page component
- Add the route configuration
- Update sidebar if requested
- Show you how to access the new page
